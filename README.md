🚴📱 OptimalRoute Tracker 🚲🛴
Executive Summary 📊
OptimalRoute Tracker is a project proposal aimed at creating a platform for mapping and monitoring routes for runners and cyclists. This solution arises from the need to map bike paths and running routes in Lima, as applications like Google Maps do not always mark a safe path for cycling. The proposed solution is to create a platform that maps existing and well-maintained bike paths, making them easily navigable. This platform focuses on students who commute to university by bicycle or other micro-transportation methods, thus facilitating and encouraging the use of eco-friendly transportation.

Our platform is optimal for users because it is easy to use and provides valuable information that can help motivate them. For example, seeing an improvement in travel time from home to university is motivating for users who aim to achieve better times. Additionally, our platform allows users to set goals, encouraging them to continue exercising and leading a healthy lifestyle. After each trip, a report with the journey data is sent to the user. These features distinguish us from other existing platforms, making our proposal ideal for students and individuals who use micro-transportation for their daily commutes.

Introduction 🚲🛴
Our solution arises from the need to obtain data while commuting from one point to another, specifically when using a mode of transportation that requires physical effort. The importance of obtaining data while traveling becomes fundamental when one wants to set personal goals or analyze the time taken for each journey, whether to improve an aspect of the commute or for more personal reasons, such as motivation or healthy living goals. Because we aim to create an optimal solution that meets these needs, we have outlined the following project objectives to have a clear vision of what we want to achieve.

Objectives 🎯
Route Mapping: Provide accurate and efficient route mapping for bicycle and scooter users.
Data Tracking: Monitor and display essential travel data, including duration, speed, and calories burned.
Goal Setting: Allow users to set and track personal goals for their journeys.
Journey History: Maintain a history of trips to enable users to compare and analyze their performance over time.
User Reports: Send detailed journey reports to users after each trip, summarizing the data collected.
Project Proposal: Route and Monitoring Platform for Runners and Cyclists 🏃‍♀️🚴
This proposal addresses the need to map bike paths and running routes in Lima, as applications like Google Maps do not always indicate safe paths for cycling. The proposed solution is a platform that maps existing and well-maintained bike paths, facilitating safe navigation. This project is particularly focused on students who commute to university by bicycle or other micro-transportation methods, thereby promoting and encouraging the use of eco-friendly transportation.

Objective 🚀
Create an application that motivates people to stay active and healthy through the creation and tracking of running and cycling routes, using GPS technology to enhance the user experience and safety.

Relevance 🌍
Environmental Impact: Reducing pollution through the use of eco-friendly transportation.
Health Benefits: Encouraging exercise to reduce the risk of heart disease and stress.
User Engagement: Providing information to track route progress and achieving personal goals in a fun and engaging way.
Key Features ✨
Custom Route Creation: Users can create their own routes or select suggested routes based on location and preferences.
Real-Time GPS Tracking: Monitor the user’s journey, distance, and speed during their activity.
Performance Analysis: Evaluate physical activity and user progress over time.
Safety Alerts: Notifications in case of deviation from the planned route or emergencies.

Architecture and Technologies Used ⚙️
OptimalRoute Tracker employs a Microservices Architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The architecture is divided into several services, including Route Service, User Service, and Data Analytics Service, each responsible for specific functionalities such as route mapping, user management, and data analysis, respectively. The application is developed using JavaScript and TypeScript, leveraging the Node.js framework for backend development. For the frontend, React is used to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. MongoDB is employed for data persistence, providing a flexible and scalable database solution. Docker is used for containerization, ensuring consistency across development and production environments. Version control is managed using Git, with the repository hosted on GitHub. This technology stack and architectural approach together facilitate a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly application.
